## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take all security vulnerabilities seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [banisterious@gmail.com](mailto:banisterious@gmail.com).

Please include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any possible mitigations
- Your name/handle if you wish to be credited

I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

## Disclosure Policy

When I receive a security bug report, I will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all affected versions
4. Release new versions of the plugin
5. Announce the vulnerability in the changelog

I ask that you:
- Allow me time to address the vulnerability before any public disclosure
- Keep the details of the vulnerability confidential until I publish a fix
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability or revealing the problem to others

## Security Update Policy

Security updates will be released as soon as possible in the form of a patch version update. I will not wait for a regular release cycle to fix critical security issues.

Users will be notified of security updates through:
- GitHub release notes
- CHANGELOG.md updates
- Community announcements where appropriate

## Privacy Considerations

Obsidian Hermetic Compass is designed with privacy in mind:

- All personal data (name, birth date, etc.) is stored locally in your Obsidian vault
- No personal information is transmitted to external servers
- Calculations are performed locally on your device
- The plugin does not collect telemetry or usage data

Users should still be aware of the following:
- If you share your Obsidian vault, your personal information stored in the plugin settings will be visible
- Backup your vault using secure methods to protect personal information
- Be cautious when sharing generated reports as they may contain personal information

## Security Best Practices

For the best security experience with Obsidian Hermetic Compass:

1. **Keep the plugin updated** to the latest version
2. **Use strong encryption** for your Obsidian vault if it contains sensitive information
3. **Be cautious with third-party plugins** that might interact with Hermetic Compass data
4. **Review permissions** of any plugins that can access your vault content
5. **Back up your data regularly** using secure methods
6. **Report any suspicious behavior** to the project maintainers
