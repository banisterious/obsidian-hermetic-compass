## Before Reporting an Issue

Before creating a new issue, please:

1. **Check for existing issues**: Search the [issue tracker](../../issues) to see if your problem has already been reported.
2. **Verify you're using the latest version**: Make sure you're using the most recent version of the plugin.
3. **Check the documentation**: Review the [documentation](./docs) to ensure the behavior you're experiencing isn't expected.
4. **Restart Obsidian**: Some issues can be resolved by simply restarting Obsidian.

## How to Report an Issue

When reporting an issue, please include:

- **Clear title**: Use a concise, descriptive title
- **Detailed description**: Explain the problem in detail
- **Steps to reproduce**: Provide specific, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Expected behavior**: Describe what you expected to happen
- **Actual behavior**: Describe what actually happened
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots if they help explain the problem
- **Environment information**:
  - Obsidian version
  - Plugin version
  - Operating system and version
  - Any relevant device information
- **Console errors**: Include any error messages from the developer console

## Issue Templates

When creating a new issue, please use the appropriate template:

- **Bug Report**: For reporting errors, unexpected behavior, or crashes
- **Feature Request**: For suggesting new features or improvements
- **Documentation Issue**: For reporting problems with the documentation

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! When requesting a feature:

- Clearly describe the feature and its purpose
- Explain how it would benefit users
- Consider potential implementation challenges
- Include mockups or examples if possible
- Check if similar requests already exist

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT report it through the public issue tracker. Instead, follow the process outlined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Issue Lifecycle

Issues go through several stages:

1. **New**: Issue has been submitted but not yet reviewed
2. **Triage**: Issue is being assessed by maintainers
3. **Confirmed**: Issue has been validated and accepted
4. **In Progress**: Work on the issue has begun
5. **Review**: Solution is being reviewed
6. **Resolved**: Issue has been fixed or addressed
7. **Closed**: Issue is considered complete or not actionable

Issues may also be labeled as:
- **Duplicate**: Issue has already been reported
- **Won't Fix**: Issue is valid but won't be addressed
- **Need More Info**: Additional information is required from the reporter
